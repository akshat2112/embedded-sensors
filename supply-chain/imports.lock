Security review of earlier versions of the crate can be found at
(Google-internal, sorry): go/image-crate-chromium-security-review

The crate exposes a function marked as `unsafe`, but doesn't use any
`unsafe` blocks (except for tests of the single `unsafe` function).  I
think this justifies marking this crate as `ub-risk-1`.

Additional review comments can be found at https://crrev.com/c/4723145/31

All two functions from the public API of this crate use `unsafe` to avoid bound
checks for an array access.  Cross-module analysis shows that the offsets can
be statically proven to be within array bounds.  More details can be found in
the unsafe review CL at https://crrev.com/c/5350386.

This crate has been added to Chromium in https://crrev.com/c/3891618.
